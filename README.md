# AIPredictionModel-TestScores
Can a computer predict a test score using study time and sleep? In the project, I trained a simple AI model using Thonny.
# Project Title
AI mini project 
## Problem
What problem were you trying to solve? Why does it matter?
I am trying to solve how to make my Ai read data to be able to predict scores. This matters because it could be helpful

## Solution
How does your project work? (High-level, no heavy jargon)
The way my project works is by reading data sheet and giving predications.
## Tools
Languages, libraries, datasets, or AI models used.
The main tools i used was thonny but for data we used google sheets. 
## Results - Output Screenshot
What worked? (accuracy, output, example, or result)
It gave an of a students test score who studied for 6 hours.
